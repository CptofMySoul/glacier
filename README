A Python library for accessing Amazon Glacier

Requires Python 2.5 or later (earlier versions not tested).
No Python 3 support yet.

Website: http://paulengstler.github.com/glacier/
Git Repository: http://github.com/paulengstler/glacier.git

The library is still work in progress and not complete but I'm working on it.
If you want to contribute feel free to do so and fork glacier on github!
