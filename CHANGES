Changes with glacier 0.11 											26 Aug 2012

Simple version:
	
	*)	The memory usage has been reduced dramatically especially for big
		files. This library is now able to operate in low-memory environments
		like the Raspberry Pi.

	*)	Uploading files is trouble-free now as the algorithm was replaced
		and "just works".

	*)	Functions have gotten detailed description in this source code.

Detailed version:

	*) 	Feature: API description. Most functions have gotten a description
		of what they do and how they operate. Those are written in a Sphix-
		compatible format.

	*) 	Change: File hash algorithm was replaced to work with low memory usage
		(utils.sha256_file).

	*)	Change: Request's body can now be a file object which will be streamed
		to the API in small chunks to keep the memory usage low.
		(Request.send_request).

	*)	Change: All lines exceeding 80 characters were shortened for better
		readability.
		
	*)	Bugfix:	Some functions had returned a JSON string instead of a 
		parsed dictionary.

	*)	Bugfix:	All imports have been reduced to their truly needed modules.

	*)	Bugfix:	Hash tree algorithm was replaced (thanks to hareevs!) to
		prevent strange and unpredictable outcomes as with the old one.
