{"body":"### What is Glacier?\r\nGlacier strives to be a simple library for using [Amazon Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) by providing an intuitive and easy to use API. Because of its license it can be included in any project.\r\n\r\n### How to install Glacier?\r\nTo install Glacier you can use _easy_install_ or _pip_:\r\n\r\n```easy_install glacier```\r\n\r\n```pip install glacier```\r\n\r\nYou can also pull the source code and install glacier manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/paulengstler/glacier.git\r\ncd glacier\r\npython setup.py install (run as admin/root)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### So, how easy to use is Glacier?\r\nOnce you get the hang of it, it will be really simple to use Glacier. This library has three built-in types ready to use:\r\n* **Connection** - The gate to connect to Amazon Glacier in the right region\r\n* **Vault** - A data storage representation to access and store your data\r\n* **Archive** - A representation of either local or remote data in Amazon's Glacier\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom glacier import Connection, Vault, Archive\r\n\r\n# establish the connection\r\nconnection = Connection(\"Access Key\",\"Secret Access Key\")\r\n\r\n# get the vault \"my_vault\"\r\nvault = connection.get_vault(\"my_vault\")\r\n\r\n# get the local file \"myfile.txt\"\r\narchive = Archive(\"/home/paul/myfile.txt\")\r\n\r\n# get the remote archive with its cryptic id\r\nrarchive = Archive(\"normallythisshouldbe138byteslong\")\r\n\r\n# delete the remote archive\r\nvault.delete(rarchive)\r\n\r\n# upload the file in \"my_vault\"\r\nvault.upload(archive)\r\n\r\n# be happy :)\r\nprint \"Great! Now my file has the ID \" + archive.id\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, it will be more difficult to understand how Amazon Glacier itself works rather than this library. \r\n\r\n### What are the downsides?\r\nGlacier is _pretty much_ untested and lacks some functionality (multipart uploads, proper error handling). However, that will change soon. Also, Glacier has no archive ID storage yet. You will have to store the archive IDs by yourself until there will be a module.\r\n\r\nThe really bad part is that Glacier has no API documentation yet. I'm working on then at them moment. However, the examples are a good start and show how the core functions work.\r\n\r\n### Can I contribute?\r\nYes, absolutely! 4 simple steps:\r\n\r\n1. Fork glacier on github\r\n\r\n2. Create a new branch\r\n\r\n3. Commit changes to that branch\r\n\r\n4. Send a pull request\r\n\r\nThanks for using Glacier!\r\n\r\n[Paul](http://paulengstler.com) :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
